            This study examines financial synergy and optimal performance of non-financial quoted firms in Nigeria. 
            The main purpose of this study is to examine the effect of financial synergy on optimal performance of non-financial quoted firms in Nigeria.
            Panel data was used sourced from financial statements of  non-financial quoted firms at the Nigeria Stock Exchange Fact Book from 2000 to 2019.
            Return on Assets, Return on Equity and Net Profit Margin were modeled as functions of Cost of debt, Cost of Equity and Tax Liability respectively.
            Panel Data regression model was adopted as the estimation technique of the study. Pooled effect, fixed effect, and random effect between the variables 
            implicated in the associated models resulting into sets of estimable equations were formulated and analyzed. Hausman test was done to ascertain the appropriate model. 
            The findings of the study show that change in cost of equity (CET) financial synergy proved statistically significant but negative relationship with return on asset (ROA),
            but all the independent variables (CDT and NPM) proved statistically insignificant with return on equity (ROE) and net profit margin (NPM). From the findings therefore, 
            the study concludes that financial synergy causes a reduction in change in cost of equity (CET) that will translate into an increase in return on asset for optimization 
             of performance of non financial quoted firms in Nigeria. Again, it also concludes that financial synergy does not always 
            translate into increase in return on equity (ROE) and net profit margin (NPM) of non financial quoted firms in Nigeria.
